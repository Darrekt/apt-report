\section{Summary of Work Done}
The basic functionalities of the existing app have been re-implemented, with major UI improvements for improved useability and a leaner user experience.


\section{Applications}



\section{Future Work}
The next steps in this project would be to start with user feedback cycles. At present, we do not expect enough users to be able to implement A/B testing. However, feedback will be built into the app and aggregated for weekly design reviews.
