\section{Deployment and Release}
An original goal of this run of the project was to deploy the application on the Google Play store for Android and the App store for Apple devices. However, a number of unforeseen circumstances have surfaced to prevent this:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Each app store requires the purchase of a developer account. In total, this costs \$125 USD.
	\item Each app store requires graphic assets for store listing pages, which require the intervention of a designer.
	\item Release on the app store requires a long review process, especially for apps which request sensitive permissions (such as this one). A privacy policy must be accessible from a verified-owned domain. 
	\item Increased app store review times at the time of intended submission meant that the app could not be live before the project deadline.
\end{itemize}

While all the above criteria are technically possible to fulfill with temporary placeholders, the release process involves several rounds of internal testing to invite-exclusive testers. Due to project and time constraints, this internal testing can be manually executed through the automated Github release, since feedback has been built-in as part of the app interface. This allows us to properly prepare the relevant resources for an app store release over the summer, in time for the next run of the project to resume development.
