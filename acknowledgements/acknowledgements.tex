\begin{acknowledgements}

I would like to express thanks to:

\begin{itemize}
 \item My supervisor, Prof. Jeremy Pitt, who has provided essential guidance and encouragement throughout the scope of this project, and also did a wonderful job of coordinating all the collaborations across experts in different disciplines.
 \vspace*{3mm}
 \item My second supervisor, Prof. Emeritus Robert Spence, whose class I was unexpectedly dropped into in my first year of university and will carry with me for the rest of my career as a developer.
 \vspace*{3mm}
 \item Leon Wiederkehr, who worked on this project before me and created the initial android release of the app on top of the literature review and motivation for the original project, allowing me to focus heavily on development and engineering work.
 \vspace*{3mm}
 \item My tight support circle of friends, whom without the guidance of I would have been lost in trying to navigate the process of building such an ambitious product within the short time span of 6 months.
\end{itemize}
