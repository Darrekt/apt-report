I would like to express thanks to:

 \item Our neuroscience consultant, Dr. Thomas Dannhauser, whose efforts are a significant driving force in the successful implementation of all the features in this project.
 \item My second supervisor, Prof. Emeritus Robert Spence, whose class I was unexpectedly dropped into in my first year of university and will carry with me for the rest of my career as a developer.

 \item Leon Wiederkehr, who worked on this project before me and created the initial android release of the app on top of the literature review and motivation for the original project, creating a starting point for the fascinating exploration into multiple fields that this project seeks to undertake.

 \item My tight support circle of friends, whom without the guidance of I would have been lost in trying to navigate the process of building such an ambitious product within the short time span of 6 months.
\end{itemize}
